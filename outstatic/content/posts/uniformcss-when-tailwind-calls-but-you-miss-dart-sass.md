**What is **[**UniformCSS**](https://uniformcss.com/)**: **

Uniform CSS is a fully configurable utility generator, and CSS framework built entirely in Sass. You can use it to generate your own framework configuration, retaining the power of utility-based development without sacrificing the benefits of sass modules.
